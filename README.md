## OllyDbg function labels

Get ODbgScript plugin .dll from http://odbgscript.sf.net and put it in OllyDbg folder
Run fo2_symbols_script.txt from Plugins-menu (fo2_symbols_script.txt can be generated by running fo2re2odbgscript.py with [Fallout2-re code](https://github.com/alexbatalov/fallout2-re))

Get function names as labels and comments:

No need to do it twice, the labels and comments are saved for the exe as .udd in the OllyDbg folder
